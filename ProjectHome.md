Introduction
Pygmy Skunk Research Systems is a fancy title for a potential group of individuals that are interested in helping design experimental UAVs. While there are many people out there that are doing the same thing, hence why this blog has begun, this is meant to create something more. It is also to fulfill a 20 year old itch.

To start already it has been decided that there will be 3 different phases, or prototype builds of this first series of UAV's. There is a series, whether the next series actually comes to light is to remain in the air so to speak.

Phase 1. Acquire and assemble pre-made systems.

This means that this will include buying a semi cheap RC plane, the radio system, the GPS unit, the autopilot unit, batteries, the software to program the thing, assembling a cheap computer system with spares to program the thing and so on and so forth.
This is the phase where most of the learning of UAV's will commence and will remain in place for some time. This is the phase where most errors will also be produced.


Phase 2. Design and build a new plane, use existing units.

This phase will be where the design and construction of a simple plane will be done. This is to learn the actual building of a plane will be conducted. This will include the CAD design, airfoil flow testing, fabrication of the airframe, construction and manual test flights. This will also use existing hardware from the previous phase, it will be transplanted into this plane and most likely stay there since this plane can serve as a future test drone.

Phase 3. Design and build new plane, project "x".

This one is hard to explain I think. This is where the tests and results of the previous planes will be the result into what will be "The Project". This will be where the ideas that have been floating around can be implemented into this. The idea is to make this an "open source" UAV system. Where the plane is designed to be upgradeable over time, with new units that can be added, new electronic parts added or just replaced, the ability to communicate with a computer system in the "hanger" as well as in flight, to be capable of not only live video feed but photo capable in high resolution. This also adds in other ideas such as a platform for new mapping technology, like using lasers to make a 3D scan of the terrain as it is flying, where this data can be loaded into a program and used for either science data, or for 3D mesh data. Or the ability to use other imaging or scanning methods, all without having to build a new plane from scratch each time a new system is added. This "open source" method allows for others to contribute as well as use and modify. I am involved with a lot of open source software projects and have adopted the ideology into this hardware project.

This project also needs to be "green", which means that no combustion engine will be used. From the start the idea to not use gas powered engines was a must, this project will involve MANY flights and the idea of producing carbon emissions is not Earth friendly, nor is it economic. This could introduce the idea of using solar cells to help power some electrical parts. However if there are night flights this makes that idea pointless, regardless the ability is there and can be considered.

Conclusion

Taking a more scientific approach, with a tinge of "black project" like persona, Pygmy Skunk Research Systems is really just a bunch of geeks with a passion for engineering, computer science and planes.
